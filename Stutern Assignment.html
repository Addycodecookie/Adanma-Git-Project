        <p style="color:rgb(5, 97, 43); font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; text-align:justify; font-size: 14px;" >My name is Adanma Egesie. I am thrilled to be part of the stutern Cohort for Software Development <br>
        My facsination with technology began from the world of gaming. I had a friend who was quite obsessed with gaming, that they <br>
    created their own game. <br> One day, he showed me the code and background-work behind creating the game. <br>I was very fascinated and awestruck <br> at how seeming basic lines of code could create strong visuals,  <br> colours and designs. <br> I aslo became more fascinated with technology when i got to know about the prospects of working on products that <br> millions of people around the world could use in their daily lives from social media to online tools 
    <br> This appealed to my creative juices and I wanted to delve into the world of software development. <br> 
    I also heard a lot of people online talk about software development online and the prospects. <br> 
    I was interested in learning a skill in tech that could provide a service or feature used by millions of people around the world <br>I saw it as a way of making an impact and touching lives </p>

        So far so good, I've become better acquainted with using Github. Before I only had some surface knowledge about it. <br> 
        I've come to know it is an online directory where fellow techie's can collaborate on projects and also share 
        their work with an online community. 
    <br> I've learned repositories, their purpose, how to download and clone repositories and also push projects there using gitbash or git desktop.
<br> I've also learned about html and how this is the skeleton of software development. HTMl deals with the structure of a page. 
<br> I've learnt about various elements and their attributes. I've also learned about HTMl forms. <br>
<br> CSS means cascading style sheet and is used for giving aesthetic definition to a project. <br> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. It is used for website layout in design and used alongside HTML.
<br> I've learned about CSS selectors and their various classes and purposes. <br> Also learned about CSS border boxing and the specific role each attribute plays in the layout and presentation of a web-project.
